                                    were influenced by the great innovations in the South; many artists travelled to Italy to study; and the Renaissance concern for bringing
                                    modern science and philosophy into art was also evident in the North. There was, however, a difference of outlook between the two cultures.
                                    In the North, change was driven by another set of preoccupations: religious reform, the return to ancient Christian values, and the revolt
                                    against the authority of the Church.</p> <p class="citation" ng-mouseenter="options=true" ng-mouseleave="options=false">citation</p>
